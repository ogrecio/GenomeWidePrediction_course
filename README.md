# Genomewide_prediction 

**Material for the Course "GENOME-WIDE PREDICTION OF COMPLEX TRAITS IN HUMANS, PLANTS AND ANIMALS (GWP)"**

Instructors: **Evangelina Lopez de Maturana**, **Oscar Gonzalez-Recio**

This course will introduce students to perform prediction of complex traits using genomic information. 
Each day the course will start at **14:00** and end at **20:00** (CET).

## Preparatory_steps: 
For computing, we will use our EC2 AWS cloud, where most of the software needed for this course are already installed.

You will, therefore, only need a few applications installed on your laptop:
 SSH client
 Windows: [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)

 Mac/Linux: not required, terminal should be installed as standard
 
 FTP client - transfers files to/from the server
 Windows/Mac/Linux -[Filezilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)

This is my recommendation but any FTP client should be fine, including Mac/Linux built-in

Please make sure that you have installed on your laptop [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Once you have R and R Studio installed on your laptop, please install this list of packages using this command:
```
rpkgs<-c("BGLR", "snpReady", "data.table", "pheatmap", "rsample", "coda", "ggplot2", "ROCR", "tidyverse", "rmarkdown","knitr", "pander", ‘remotes’, ‘bigreadr’, ‘ggpubr’)
install.packages(rpkgs)

remotes::install_github("privefl/bigsnpr")
```

It is likely that when you install snpReady you get a message saying that ‘impute’ R package is necessary. You can install it as follows.
```
 if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
 install.packages("BiocManager")
 BiocManager::install("impute")
```

The ultimate check whether a package installation was successful is to load the package into your R session via:

 > library(<packagename>)
 #eg library(ggplot2)

**Day 5**: Practical session
- Build your own Genome-enabled prediction. Breakout rooms
 
 This is your [reference population](data/hackathon/training_hack.ped) and the corresponding [map file](data/hackathon/training_hack.map), and these are the [candidate individuals](data/hackathon/testing_hack.ped) and [SNP map file](data/hackathon/testing_hack.map) to predict their genomic value.
 
 Hackathon steps:
 - Imputation
 - Determine your predictive accuracy (internal), with different methods/models
 - Predict yet-to-be observed phenotypes with your preferred method(s)
 - submit results to instructors for final check
